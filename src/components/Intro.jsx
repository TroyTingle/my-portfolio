        I am a junior full stack developer with a background in theoretical
        physics. I recently graduated with a degree in physics and have been
        working to expand my skills in web development. I am a fast learner and
        am always eager to take on new challenges. My education in theoretical
        physics has provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and
        logical thinking that I believe will serve me well in my new career. I
        have a good understanding of web development and have knowledge in HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, and some web development frameworks. I am excited to
        continue learning and growing as a developer and am looking forward to
        the opportunity to work on real-world projects and gain hands-on
        experience.
